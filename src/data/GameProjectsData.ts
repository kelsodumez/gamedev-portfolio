            <strong>Tuhua</strong> is a serious text-based game made for a client project where the player must work through a series of small narratives in order to maximise the amount of lives they save in a volcanic emergency.

            The development of Tuhua was a really insightful look into the game development process for me, as I was in charge of editing and rewriting other group members narratives I was able to really further my understanding of some of the struggles that can occur in any asset pipeline.
